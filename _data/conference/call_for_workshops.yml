      We invite proposals for workshops, tutorials or other satellite events, on
      any topic related to formal structures in computation, deduction and
      automated reasoning, from theoretical foundations to tools and
      applications.


      Satellite events will take place on the 29 June and 4-5 July, before and
      after the main conference (30 June - 5 July). It is expected that satellite
      events would run for 1 or 2 days, and be open to participants of parallel
      events.

  - title: Proposals
    content:  >
      Proposals must be limited to three pages and should be submitted by email to
      <ws.org@fscd2020.org>. Each proposal should consist of the following two parts.

      - A description part including:
        - a short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and
          the particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a list
          of previous or related workshops (if relevant);
        - a brief description (up to 120 words) of the event for the website and
          publicity material.

      - An organisational part including:
        - contact information for the workshop organizers;
        - proposed affiliated conference;
        - estimate of the number of workshop participants;
        - proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials, demo sessions, etc.)
        - potential invited speakers;
        - procedures for selecting papers and participants;
        - tentative schedule for paper submission and notification of acceptance;
        - plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. a journal special issue);
        - duration (which may vary from one day to two days);
        - preferred period (pre, or post main conferences).
        - any other special requirements.

      The Organizing Committee of FSCD-IJCAR will determine the final list of
      accepted workshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop Chairs of
      the hosting conferences and availability of space and facilities.


      The organizers of satellite events are expected to create and maintain a
      website for the event; handle paper selection, reviewing and acceptance; draw
      up a tentative programme of talks; advertise their event though specialist
      mailing lists; prepare the informal pre-proceedings (if applicable) in a
      timely fashion; and arrange any post-proceedings. Some amount of financial
      support may be offered to workshops, depending on the number of participants.


      The FSCD-IJCAR organizing committee will handle promotion of the event on the
      main conference website; integration of the event's programme into the
      overall timetable; registration of participants; arrangement of an
      appropriate meeting room; and provision of lunch and coffee breaks for
      participants.
