      FSCD (<http://fscdconference.org/>) covers all aspects of
      formal structures for computation and deduction from theoretical
      foundations to applications. Building on two communities, RTA
      (Rewriting Techniques and Applications) and TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi
      and Applications), FSCD embraces their core topics and broadens
      their scope to closely related areas in logics, models of computation,
      semantics and verification in new challenging areas.

      The suggested, but not exclusive, list of topics for submission is:

      1. **Calculi:** Rewriting systems (string, term, higher-order,
      graph,conditional, modulo, infinitary, etc.); Lambda calculus;
      Logics(first-order, higher-order, equational, modal, linear,
      classical,constructive, etc.); Proof theory (natural deduction,
      sequent calculus, proof nets, etc.); Type theory and logical
      frameworks;Homotopy type theory; Quantum calculi.

      2. **Methods in Computation and Deduction:** Type systems (poly-morphism,
      dependent, recursive, intersection, session, etc.); Induction, coinduction;
      Matching, unification, completion, orderings; Strategies (normalization,
      completeness, etc.); Tree automata; Model building and model checking; Proof
      search and theorem proving; Constraint solving and decision procedures.

      3. **Semantics:** Operational semantics and abstract machines; Game
      Semantics and applications; Domain theory and categorical models;
      Quantitative models (timing, probabilities, etc.); Quantum computation
      and emerging models in computation.

      4. **Algorithmic Analysis and Transformations of Formal Systems:** Type
      Inference and type checking; Abstract Interpretation; Complexity
      analysis and implicit computational complexity;Checking termination,
      confluence, derivational complexity and related properties; Symbolic
      computation.

      5. **Tools and Applications:** Programming and proof
      environments; Verification tools; Proof assistants and interactive
      theorem provers; Applications in industry; Applications of formal
      systems in other sciences.

      6. **Semantics and Verification in new challenging areas:** Certification;
      Security; Blockchain protocols; Data Bases; Deep learning and machine
      learning algorithms; Planning.

  - title: Submission Guidelines
    content: |
      Submissions must be formatted using the
      [LIPIcs style files](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors)
      and submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd2020).

      Submissions can be made in two categories.

      * **Regular Research Papers.**
        They are limited to 15 pages, excluding references.
        They must present original research which is unpublished
        and not submitted elsewhere.  Proofs and other technical
        details that do not fit within the page limit can be
        submitted as an appendix (up to 5 pages). The appendix will be
        consulted at the discretion of the reviewers. Therefore, submissions
        must be self-contained within the respective page limit; the
        additional material should not be necessary to assess
        the merits of a submission.

      * **System Descriptions.**
        They are limited to 15 pages, excluding references. They must
        present new software tools, or significantly new versions of such tools,
        in which FSCD topics play an important role. An archive of the code with
        instructions on how to install and run the tool must be submitted.
        In addition, a webpage where the system can be experimented with
        should be provided.

      One author of an accepted paper is expected to present it at the conference.

  - title: Best Paper Award by Junior Researchers
    content: >
      The program committee will select a paper in which at least one author is a
      junior researcher, i.e. either a student or whose PhD award date is less than
      three years from the first day of the meeting. Other authors should declare
      to the PC Chair that at least 50% of contribution is made by the junior
      researcher(s).

  - title: Publication
    content: >
      The proceedings will be published as an electronic volume in the Leibniz
      International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) of Schloss Dagstuhl. All
      LIPIcs proceedings are open access.

  - title: Special Issue
    content: >
      Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit an extended version to a
      special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science.
