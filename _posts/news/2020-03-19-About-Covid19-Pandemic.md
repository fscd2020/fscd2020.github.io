We are facing an unprecedented public health crisis because of Covid-19 outbreak.

The organisers and the steering committees of IJCAR-FSCD 2020 are monitoring the evolution of the situation.

France and many other European countries are in lockdown and travelling is subject to strongly restrictions all over the world. We do not know how long these restrictions will last.

We are taking into account all the options, which include a complete virtualisation of the conferences, with video presentations and remote participation.

A more detailed statement about the running of IJCAR-FCSD 2020 conferences and workshops will be issued by the first week of April.
