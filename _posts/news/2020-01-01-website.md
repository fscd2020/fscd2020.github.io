The FSCD 2020 website <http://fscd2020.org> has been restructured and it is now tightly connected to the newly published IJCAR-FSCD 2020 website <http://fscd-ijcar-2020.org>, which contains all the info relevant to both the 5th FSCD and the 10th IJCAR colocated in Paris, and to their satellite workshops.

Some new sections and pages have been added to the FSCD 2020 site. In particular:

- the list of the invited speakers is now available and published on the front page;

- a page of FSCD 2020 news <http://fscd2020.org/news.html> has been added.
