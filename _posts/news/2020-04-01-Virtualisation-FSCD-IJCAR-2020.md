The organising committee of IJCAR and FSCD have decided that the 2020 edition of both the conferences will become virtual and will be held at a distance. The proceedings of both IJCAR and FSCD will be published as usual. We are also working with workshop organisers in order to virtualise satellite events too.

We are aiming at recreating a virtual experience as closed as possible to the physical one. We are currently exploring video conferencing platforms allowing to share a virtual common space for the main conferences and their satellite workshops, where participants may not only attend talks and ask questions to speakers, but also have informal interactions with each others, e.g. a sort of “virtual coffee breaks”.
